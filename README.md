# Dermaviz: Comprehensive Research Suite for integrated Phenotyping, Genotyping and 3D Modeling for NF patients

Dermaviz is a full research suite designed to advance and integrate the collection of data from NF patients.


## Abstract: We have created an easy-to-use iOS mobile application that creates a 3D model, integrates, This solution is scalable able

  

## Introduction: Neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 is a highly heterogeneous

  

## Methods *: How did we go about solving it?*

  

## Results *: What did we observe? Figures are great!*

  

We created an iOS app that takes a 3D scan of a patientâ€™s face

  

## Conclusion/Discussion:

  

### Please make sure you address ALL of the following:

  

#### *1. What additional data would you like to have*

  

#### *2. What are the next rational steps?*

  

#### *3. What additional tools or pipelines will be needed for those steps?*

  

#### *4. What skills would additional collaborators ideally have?*

  

## Reproduction: *How to reproduce the findings!*

  

### Docker

  

*The Docker image contains <R/jupyter> notebooks of all analyses and the dependencies to run them. *Be sure to note if you need any special credentials to access data for these analyses, **don't package restricted data** in your containers!*

  

Instructions for running the following notebooks: *be sure to adjust these instructions as necessary! check out https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/nf-hackathon-2019 for example containers and instructions*

  

1. `docker pull <your dockerhub repo>/<this container>` command to pull the image from the DockerHub

2. `docker run <your dockerhub repo>/<this container>` Run the docker image from the master shell script

  

### Important Resources *: primary data, github repository, Synapse project, dockerfile link etc.*
